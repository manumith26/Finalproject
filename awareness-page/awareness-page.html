            <h3> Recovery story of sanjay dutt</h3>
            <p>  
                In 2020, actor Sanjay Dutt decided to toughen up rather than crumble as he entered the meeting room of his oncologist, Dr. Sewanti Limaye, one week after receiving the news that he had advanced lung cancer. He was also the epitome of serenity, in contrast to the melancholy and weeping fits he had confessed to after his recovery. "He had faced his reckoning hour and taken a stand. He said to me, "I'm going to move forward as if I never had cancer. All I have to do is breathe, concentrate on getting my life back, and use whatever discipline is required to achieve that." For him, negativity was never an option. I believe he arrived with the most effective form of therapy available his intellect, tenacity, and resolve. And you've already won more than half the fight," she claims. Dutt had a 50:50 chance of surviving and had already lost his mother and first wife to cancer, so it was nothing new to him. Furthermore, the recollections, which he revealed to the world once he recovered, just made him feel more depressed about the inevitable end of his life. Then he felt they were worth a battle, considering his family and kids. a strong one. He had a very great mental fortitude, never concealed his sickness, and embraced the task from the start. He was honest with his family and friends, didn't mind being weak in front of them, and embraced their strength when needed. Support from friends and family is the second most effective therapy available; they can help you get through the low points that come with receiving any kind of cancer treatment, according to Dr. Limaye. In addition, patients in the doctor's rehab unit support, depend on, and learn from one another when they have no family or friends.

            <h3> kathy bates cancer fight</h3>
            <p> Breast cancer runs in Kathy Bates's family, and she knew at an early age that it was just a matter of time until the disease found its way to her.

                Bates tells Yahoo Lifestyle, "I first learned about breast cancer when I overheard my Aunt Lee's voice on the phone. I could hear her voice breaking as she said, 'I have breast cancer.'"
                
                Bates' mother later had the illness in the 1970s and had a drastic mastectomy as a result. The actress claims, "I knew that at some point I would get breast cancer."
                
                
                "Diagnosing ovarian cancer is really difficult," she continues. Bates' doctor found a lump during a gynecological checkup; it turned out to be stage 1 ovarian cancer. According to her, "it was going to attach itself to my colon, meaning it would become a stage 3." Bates experienced "the stuffing out of me" after undergoing nine rounds of chemotherapy.

                Even though Bates was a talkative person, she kept her cancer struggles quiet, which had a negative psychological impact on her. Since I'm rather honest and forthright, it was difficult for me to keep it to myself. However, I stopped participating in all of my hobbies at the same time," she says. "I don't believe that until I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, I truly came out as a cancer survivor." Bates had an MRI at that time because she hadn't been feeling well and was concerned that her ovarian cancer could be coming back. She had a tumor in her left breast, the test found. "I found breast cancer to be far more challenging than ovarian cancer," she states. "It goes without saying that losing one's breasts externally is considerably more obvious. And while I didn't have ovarian cancer, I was in a lot of agony.

                But she had other difficulties as well. Bates also had lymphedema, a painful swelling that occurs when lymph fluid accumulates in the fatty tissues beneath the skin, usually in the arms or legs. This is a side effect that some people have following cancer treatment. It is believed that up to 10 million Americans suffer from this illness.
                During a gynecological examination, Bates' physician discovered a tumor that later proved to be stage 1 ovarian cancer. She said that "it was going to attach itself to my colon, meaning it would become a stage 3." Bates said she felt like "the stuffing out of me" following her nine chemotherapy treatments.

                Despite her outgoing nature, Bates maintained her battle with cancer a secret, which negatively affected her mental health. It was hard for me to keep it to myself since I'm really direct and honest. But at the same time, I stopped engaging in all of my interests," she claims. "I don't believe that until I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, I truly came out as a cancer survivor."                 </p>
